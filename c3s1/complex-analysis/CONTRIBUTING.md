Hi! 

If you are here, then I expect that you want to help me with this project, and I am excited about that.

How you can help:
1. create an Issue on GitHub if you found a type or error;
2. write to n.skybytskyi@gmail.com if you want to help with overall structure or contents of the document.

Thanks in advance for your contribution!
